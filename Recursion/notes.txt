Recursion

    Recursion is a a method where the solution to a problems depends on soutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursive
functions will call themselves until a base condition is met. 

Steps to solving problems with recursion
1. Divide into smaller problems
2. Specify base condition to stop recursive function

count_down(n)
{
    printf(n);
    count_down(n - 1);
}

    When in a recursive function, if function is called before action is taken, it "reverses" the function. Ex:
 
count_up(n)
{
    count_up(n - 1);
    printf(n);
}

    This behavior is categorized as calling and returning phase. If you call first, then "return" backwards through the function, 
this will perform actions in reverse. Also refered to as ascedning and descending.
