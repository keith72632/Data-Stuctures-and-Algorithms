Why use linked lists?
    Arrays are fixed in size, which is a problem when using dynamic memory. Linked Lists alleviate this problem. Arrays are declared
in stack, Linked Lists and dynamic memory are stored in heap. Linked Lists are composed of an intial pointer, which points to an
element in heap, which also has a pointer that points to the next element. 

Creating Linked List:
    Linked lists are a collection of nodes, where each node contains data and pointer to next node. First node is called Head.
